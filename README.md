## About

### My moto for this website:

#### “μ-dan-ic” your ideas we develop.

> Hello, my name is Cody and I build websites for small business. I created Mudanic in 2018
> after my graduation from Georgia Institute of Technology.

> I want to bring the unique ideas of each client to the forefront of the modern day web. I want to make sure all these beautiful small businesses can use the web as a tool to help them thrive and grow.

> In May of 2018 I finished my studies as a full stack flex website developer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. May of 2017 I received a B.S. in biochemistry from Kennesaw State University located in Kennesaw, GA. As I was getting my B.S. I worked towards a tea sommelier certification from the International Tea Masters Association, of which I received in May of 2017.

> I have traveled to Nepal, Japan, Europe, Canada, and the Caribbean. Traveling is one of my many passions and I hope to continue it throughout my life. Traveling around has given my a deep appreciation for small businesses. They have made a lot of my experience throughout the world ones I will remember for the rest of my life.
